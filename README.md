In a code block, I show you the name of the technologies that I use to make this project:

## OffLine User Interface:

When you open the page, the server displays a page with a simple welcome and a login to enter to your site. What is your psite? It's a place that allows you to add and delete some subjects. But, if you want to use the app, you need to have an account.

Oh no... Do you not have an account? don't worry, you can create one in the register part. you only need to click in the navbar button that has a person with a sign of plus, and here you are, the page displays and form, but no to login, otherwise register. In this. you can create a new account.
